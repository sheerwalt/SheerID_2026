	- This call will be to try to brainstorm what rates we could wand to limit
	- Set this for for about 2-3 weeks from now so bean counter has some time to operate
	- we are hoping some rate limit shapes appear in the bean counter
	- See [The Rate Limit Service 2025 Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVGUU-nGc=/)
